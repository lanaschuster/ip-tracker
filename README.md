## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Nuxt 2
- Express
- Axios
- Scss
- Vue Leaflet
- Eslint + Prettier

### What I learned

I learned how to use Express + Nuxt.js.

### Continued development

It would be interesting to improve the empty states and error handling.

### Useful resources

- [Vue Leaflet documentation](https://vue2-leaflet.netlify.app/) - This helped me to setup the plugin.
